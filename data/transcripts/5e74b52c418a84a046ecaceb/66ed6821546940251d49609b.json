And then we also have an APP called ki pie，which is are helping your broadcasters or video makers to easily edit their are scripts, and then the video will actually stitch together. You can also add some effect to make IT looks very much like this reality show effects, highlighting the points that you want to say so much. So I think generative AI has brought sort um into helping to create economy a little bit of myself. I feel very compelled to talk about something related to music because of the other people in two thousand and twenty, pretty twenty three, I didn't train a lot of AI, but I train myself playing classical piano and IT was actually very painful process but ended up my able to finish the LTCL programs actually quite have really echo with a lot of the previous pilots view that um you know learning instruments do very important and there is a some some human elements that that really cannot be um replaced by AI at the moment but in the future who knows right let me just pass .",

And um so we has had a product I think in seventeen or eighteen which is called news tracer and it's basically doing something that a Normal human being, a reporter will not be able to do basic cripes, seven hundred million daily trees from back then is still a twitter and basically it's identifying what are the breaking news.",

So the first thing, for example, is if there's like a random person you want to remove from the photo, you can use AI just highlight that and then the person will be gone and the background will be generated as if the photo is it's no original.

Your airline, you know you can really do much about IT unless you go to to see AA surgeon but again, our APP can do IT um and for video as well like you know we would have thought that initially no video could be a more you know representative of how you look at you look like but now you can add a lot of you know cosmetics.

We are having this like new uh new technology like image processing and video processing. And uh my point is from like what I said is we are seeing more and more a people are having the capability to present their idea to the world with this new AI to and from uh but from my a perspective from like uh what I was saying is from the concentration perspective, but like uh, i'm also a software engineer. So from like software developing perspective，i'm also experiencing this. A new paradise shift is like, uh, previously I was a focused on computer region and when we were developing some a new a apps or maybe functions, we were thinking like, uh, where should we get the training data if if that actually like a real a real case happen like two months ago, like I was thinking having this uh uh developed this APP to uh maybe give you a score like on uh, how you look today but like a we were talking like from old perspective, I was thinking where should we get the training data? Like where should we get those daily look photos and get the scores but that all of sudden we will think you oh no, we we can have we can just directly use uh maybe GPT for all because like we are having this like common uh technology base so that we could uh use IT uh to do what we want uh previously is not uh is not possible but like now we are having this uh uh common technology base that we can use like we we have at our dispose .",

Um so I think as as as a productivity um APP company or AI application company are our go with to really just try to see a Better tools so users can be more efficient. And at the end, I think the beneficiary will be consumers because you are able to get more details about the things that you want to buy.

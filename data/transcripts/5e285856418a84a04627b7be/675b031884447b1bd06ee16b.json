ML, or machine learning, is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML is the approach that has been gaining momentum, especially in business, by letting machines learn from vast amounts of data and make predictions or decisions.",

        "question": "What are the three main types of machine learning?",
        "answer": "The three main types of machine learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, machines learn from labeled data to predict outcomes, like a child learning to identify animals with the help of labeled flash cards. Unsupervised learning involves machines finding patterns and relationships in data without labels, akin to sorting laundry without knowing what each item is beforehand. Reinforcement learning is about machines learning through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties, and optimizing their behavior for maximum rewards, similar to a dog learning tricks by getting rewards for correct actions.",

Good data for machine learning means data that is not only abundant but also of high quality and directly relevant to the task at hand. High-quality data ensures that the machine learning models can operate effectively and make accurate predictions or decisions. Data that is not relevant or of poor quality can lead to ineffective machine learning outcomes, similar to 'garbage in, garbage out.' Data quality is paramount for translating real-world information into a form that machines can understand, which is where data engineering comes into play.",

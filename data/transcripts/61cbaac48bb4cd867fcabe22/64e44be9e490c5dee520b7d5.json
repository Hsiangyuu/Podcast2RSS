Uh, we spend so much time formatting our ideas and the lining boxes, when, you know, what's really important is crafting the content in beyond present, you know, all the ideas you have in a way that is compelling and engaging to the audience.

So we released just on on product time and IT end up being pretty well received by the community. So you know we uh ended up winning product of the month after month, uh definitely drove uh significant number more sign ups and um and so that was basically uh August of twenty twenty two is when the public later launched and then we spent the next order of several months and quarters really um taking a step back, realizing that at that point in time, there was also a lot going on with AI.",

And so um the idea of slide started off as being something that was very much a visual aid for the presenter. IT was always intended to be something that presenter could stand next to or point to and um and being a strong visual laid to required the the human uh at the presenter to really be the the voice over to build to actually present the content.",

So much of our work today is virtual where we don't aren't always in the same room just like today. You know we could be talking uh, over screen share or you know you call in screen sharing instead of all being in the same room staring at the same screen.",

Uh, almost every one of us has had to create a presentation in one form or another. And so then it's about, okay, can we actually observe when someone is creating a presentation where they spending their time and energy and are there um sort of uh categories of problems that we start observing over and over again?",

So what you really want to do is not just take what they say uh, as the absolute truth, but again, go back to observing how they're using the product. And as you're releasing the product to more more people rather than asking them, then it's about observing do they come back to the product, they're using the product over and over and you start seeing pockets of stickiness where certain types of user come back over and over again.",

And if that that starts to becoming more more consistent, then you feel like, okay, there's there's something there that you can really hone in on and in craft uh versus in the very beginning, it's you know it's it's unclear. It's all these things that you have ideas in your head and you have different uh, hypothesis. But you really need to get to the point where you're hearing consistency from.

This is PAI though, so it's still required the user to go in to learn your building blocks and to spend enough time such that um they could understand why they should spend more time in your product and why he was useful.",

They come back that fn al was was um there is a very a steep drop of people were not able to spend enough time in the product. So when we um thought about work at AI help is really around accelerating the sort of understanding of what is gamma in the very first new minute.",

I just wonder you know what type of what kinds of strategy or you know regarding the go to market or to how do you attract your this first broader range of users, you know how what kind of channels are ways that you try to um attract more customers?",

I'm certainly with our early investors just having them start talking about our product more more and just driving some initial level of uh, enthusiasm for for what we're trying to do when our um kind of private data was announced as part of our our fund rates as well. You know that another way where things just started, um kind of uh, you you'll just get some inherent level of interest broadly and so then you drive even more sign up.",

I think gradually IT was doing IT more gradual, allowed us to have much more control and then understanding like as we're making changes, like what things are working so that we can contain an navigate the big sort of uh, when we really did open Operator much more IT was really was the product launch.",

And so you get some feedback there. But I think doing uh when when you're actually preparing for a much more big public launch at that point in time, it's not just about the product, it's about how you talk about the product. So so much of IT is the positioning IT is how do you describe IT in a way that someone, again, that has no time or patients to learn about a new tool, how can you capture the attention? And to build a work on really the positioning piece of IT, you need enough time to kind of understand how your users talk about your product, how they talk about the value you bring to them and then try to craft something that you think is really gna, uh, resonate more broadly.",

And so it's forced me to to kind of be very clear, you know, when i'm working, when i'm not, which you know before kids are all sort of sort of blood together, which also meant that you are kind of not always being efficient. You kind of you know stumbling three things all the time. And so for me at least, it's forced me to be more deliberate with with my use of time and a the other part of IT is IT becomes much easier, at least for the product building to imagine what I would be like if my kids were using our product in the future and like what is the quality bar of a product that would be interesting enough for them to want to use, for them to want to tell her friends and be proud of the product that we've built.

        "answer": "Initially, gamma was formed at the end of 2020, and they took a patient approach to build the foundation for their product. By the end of 2021, they launched a private beta and over time, grew the user base and announced the public release in August 2022.

      },
      {
        "question": "What was the key factor in validating the universal problem that gamma was solving?",
        "answer": "The key factor in validating the universal problem was spending time with users, observing where they spent the most time, and identifying recurring categories of problems while creating presentations. The consistency in user feedback and the observed user behavior helped in honing in on the core value provided by the product.",

        "question": "What did the company learn after launching their public data announcement?",
        "answer": "After launching their public data announcement, the company observed an explosion of new users, but also noted that many people were not able to spend enough time in the product to reach an 'Aha' moment where they could see its value.

        "question": "How does the preassembled set of building blocks from AI aid user experience?",
        "answer": "The preassembled set of building blocks from AI aids the user experience by reducing the initial learning time required to understand the product's components. Instead of learning new building blocks, users can immediately see a constructed set, which makes the product more accessible and encourages play and exploration.",

        "question": "What strategy did the company use to attract its first broader range of users?",
        "answer": "The company started by deliberately keeping its user base small, inviting friends and former colleagues to use the product. They observed repeat usage and then began to talk about the product more publicly within their social networks and with early investors. This gradual approach allowed them to have control and to understand what was working effectively.",

      {
        "question": "What is the importance of positioning and messaging for a product like GA?",
        "answer": "Positioning and messaging are crucial for a product like GA because they help to communicate the value proposition in a way that is easily understood by potential users who may not have time or patience to learn about a new tool. The messaging should resonate broadly and reflect the unique vision or ambition of the company.",

        "question": "What was the change in product messaging for GA from early stages to public launch?",
        "answer": "The product messaging for GA changed from an early focus on the simplicity of creating presentations without spending much time on formatting to a broader vision where GA could be a medium for people to communicate their ideas, not just for presentations but also as a static document or website.",

      },
      {
        "question": "What does the company look for when determining product market fit (PMF)?",
        "answer": "The company looks for strong word of mouth, customers spontaneously telling their friends about the product, and an ability to convert free users to paying customers while retaining them over time. Product market fit is also about quality native growth where the company can keep up with user demands and the users are enthusiastic about the product's direction.",

        "question": "What are the different ways to determine a suitable price point for a product?",
        "answer": "The speaker mentioned using survey questions to determine a range of acceptable prices. These include understanding the high end of the price point where the product becomes too expensive, the low end where quality is questioned, and also assessing relative price points compared to other commonly used tools like Salesforce.",
        "time": "00:29:50"
      },
      {
        "question": "How did the company gather insights on the value perceived by their customers?",
        "answer": "The company gathered insights by asking customers about the relative importance of features, distinguishing between mission-critical and 'nice to have' features. They also looked at the value proposition to understand what drives the needle for their customers as businesses.",

      },
      {
        "question": "What unexpected findings did the company encounter during their pricing surveys?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What does the speaker suggest about the pricing strategy for startups?",
        "answer": "The speaker suggests that startups should not set the price once and for all but should be willing to adapt and learn, constantly adjusting their pricing strategy. They also emphasize the importance of focusing not only on pricing but also on the value metric that is most relevant to the customer.",
        "time": "00:34:07"
      },
      {

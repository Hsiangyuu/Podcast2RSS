I know I just disbelieve that he has shown us that he was absolutely disappointed in the product and he was like, you guys, your first idea was actually pretty good, but why did you end up building a second idea is but uh but that's like that's kind of what kill the second idea so so then and then we start you know going back to the first one, I think about, okay, how can we make IT actually worked um and then we just keep your twain the product and then you know eventually we we got to got IT to where IT is today.",

So back your questions are how do you find out the market fit? Um my take on this question is slightly different from like uh uh the textbook answer where like you you throwing in the MVP on all that um I mean those tennis are fine uh but I care a lot more about learning about the user because I think that is the uh the at the other day the ultimate objector is to become an expert of the user and building MVP or like I think to to use a chinese risk快速试错right is is I just a take tactic to learn about the user？",

Uh MVP comes when you already have some well and educated guesses about the users need, and then you really build an MVP to test that high part. This is specifically, but at the very begin, you sometimes you don't even know who your users are, right? I think there is this a very important step that II, the most founders have skip through.",

Um you can even make the opposite case where if everybody's writing code and nobody talked to the user like it's almost test in to to fail, there will be a exception that but I think in general, that's very much especially anything that is on the application layers that requires a very nuances understanding of the user case and by definition and he will focus we new one's understanding of the user does not come from not talking to user that that are very interesting .",

Uh and also Better way is why like founders doing doing sales uh yourself is is extremely important is you start to be able to calibrate the kind of feedback that you get from the user relative to the probability of closing the deal because the user is gone to give you a lot of ideas and but not all the ideas is gonna help you close the deal because you are doing sales.",

        "answer": "Jeremy, also known as Yellow, initially wanted to become a banker and enrolled in the business school at New York University (NYU). During his freshman year, he shifted his focus towards mathematics and computer science, spending more time in the math department than in business. After graduating with two degrees, he worked at Airbnb in the Bay Area for three years. However, he realized that starting a company made more sense for him because he wanted to create something unique and impactful for users. This led him to start a company with his co-founders, Thomas Lee and Daniel, after they reached out to him while studying at NYU.",

        "question": "What was the initial idea behind the company and how did it change over time?",
        "answer": "The initial idea was to create a web application that would provide financial data, similar to rebuilding some parts of Bloomberg's fundamental data function. Initially, they considered making a reader application for financial documents with AI integration. However, after getting feedback from a friend who was disappointed with the second idea, they pivoted back to the first idea and focused on enhancing it. This led them to develop Lupa, the world's first AI-powered fundamental and historical data provider for financial analysts.",

      },
      {
        "question": "What valuable lessons did Jeremy learn from his experience at Airbnb?",
        "answer": "Jeremy joined Airbnb's growth team and learned about growth hacking techniques used by Facebook, such as A/B testing, to increase user engagement and other important metrics like 'first-time night bookings.' He emphasized the importance of quickly validating ideas and suggested that founders should focus on understanding user problems before scaling infrastructure, rather than starting with the most scalable solutions.",

      },
      {
        "question": "What approach does Jeremy advocate for validating ideas and learning about users?",
        "answer": "Jeremy advocates for prioritizing quick validation of ideas and gaining insights into user problems over building scalable infrastructure in the early stages of a startup. He suggests that founders should spend a considerable amount of their time talking to users instead of coding, which could lead to more efficient use of their engineering skills. This approach involves conducting regular debriefings as a team and recording customer conversations to understand users better. Jeremy believes that talking to users is crucial and should be prioritized over coding, especially in the initial stages of a startup, to form a deep understanding of the user base.",

      {
        "question": "Why is it important to verify that the founding team is indeed the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)?",
        "answer": "It is important to verify the founding team as the ICP because the assumption that the team represents the ideal customer for the product may not be true. This assumption needs to be checked and may be risky to skip without proper verification.",

      },
      {
        "question": "What are the potential risks of not talking to users if you assume you know them?",
        "answer": "Not talking to users when you assume you understand them can lead to critical decisions being overlooked. It may result in missing out on discovering that a different user segment is more underserved or that the market is smaller than anticipated. Additionally, it can result in a lack of rigor in thinking and lead to dangerous assumptions about the product's market and user needs.",

      },
      {
        "question": "How can the assumption that you are the ICP lead to incorrect assumptions about your product's market?",
        "answer": "Assuming that you are the ICP can lead to incorrect assumptions about the product's market if you don't talk to other users. You might not realize that there are better or more underserved segments of the market. Moreover, your focus as the ICP may not capture the full spectrum of the user base, leading to a narrow understanding of the market potential.",

      {
        "question": "What are the benefits and risks of treating the process of creating a product as if you are the only user?",
        "answer": "Being a user of your product can be beneficial as it provides a personal connection to the product's success. However, it also poses risks, as you may not be critical enough about your assumptions or thinking, leading to potentially dangerous and less rigorous decision-making processes. This can result in overlooking important user needs and creating a product that does not meet the broader market's expectations.",

        "question": "How did the speaker's experience lead them to change their approach to product development?",
        "answer": "The speaker's experience of showing a barely built product to a close friend who was angry and disappointed led to a reality check. This experience made them realize the importance of having a clear understanding of their assumptions and the need to verify them by talking to users. As a result, they started building a real Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and adopted a user-centric approach to development.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Why is it crucial to check your assumptions about your product's market and user needs?",
        "answer": "It is crucial to check your assumptions about your product's market and user needs because even if you are part of the target market (ICP), your personal experience may not represent the entire user spectrum. This can result in a misjudgment of the full user experience and the market potential, leading to a product that fails to resonate with the broader user base.",

        "question": "What does the speaker suggest as a key part of the user-centric approach to product development?",
        "answer": "The speaker suggests that a key part of the user-centric approach to product development is building a real MVP that reflects the true spirit of minimum viable product, which could range from a simple landing page to a more developed concept. The focus should be on selling the idea and gathering feedback before fully building the product. This iterative process helps refine the product based on user interaction and feedback.",

      {
        "question": "What is the core problem with existing products in the market according to the speaker?",
        "answer": "According to the speaker, the core problem with existing products in the market is that they do not fully understand the psychology of the user and do not address trust issues that prevent adoption. Users may not trust the data provided by these products due to concerns about accuracy and the potential consequences of using unreliable data. The existing products often try to standardize non-standard financial data, leading to inaccuracies.",

      },
      {
        "question": "How does the speaker's product build trust with users?",
        "answer": "The speaker's product builds trust with users by allowing them to audit the data directly from the source document. Users can click on a number and see where it comes from, ensuring the data's accuracy. Additionally, the product displays all data as disclosed by the companies, avoiding the standardization of non-standard financial disclosures which reduces inaccuracies and builds trust.",

        "question": "What is the approach taken by the speaker's product to handle non-standard financial data?",
        "answer": "The approach taken by the speaker's product to handle non-standard financial data is to display all the data as disclosed by the companies without trying to fit it into a standard template. This prevents the loss of nuances in the data and ensures that users receive information exactly as it is disclosed by the companies, which builds trust with the users.",

The team incorporated user insights into the product roadmap, which led to the refinement and improvement of the product based on real user experiences and needs.",
        "time": "00:29:09"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the strategy for incorporating user feedback into product development?",
        "answer": "The strategy involves observing patterns across a specific segment of users who express a similar need or pain point. The company collects data-driven feedback and looks for recurring issues among users with similar profiles. This approach helps in understanding whether the feedback is a significant issue worth addressing in the product.",
        "time": "00:29:45"
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is it important to have a large volume of feedback when determining user needs?",
        "answer": "Having a large volume of feedback is important because it allows the company to discern patterns and signals from noise. When there's a pattern of the same problem articulated by several users with similar profiles, it becomes easier to validate that the issue is significant and worth solving within the product.",
        "time": "00:30:15"
      },
      {
        "question": "How can founders use sales experience to inform product feature prioritization?",
        "answer": "Founders can use their sales experience to gauge the probability of closing a deal based on user feedback. They can determine whether a suggested feature makes it easier to close deals or if it leads to more engagement with the user, such as involving their boss or legal team. This helps in identifying features that not only resonate with users but also contribute to the sales process.",
        "time": "00:31:08"
      },
      {
        "question": "What should a product team consider to ensure they have sufficient data for decision-making?",
        "answer": "The team should aim to gather enough data to build conviction among themselves about the direction to pivot. This means having a substantial amount of feedback from users that allows them to resolve internal debates about which features or direction to pursue. A data-driven approach with a large number of user interactions is preferred over a small, highly qualitative dataset.",

      },
      {
        "question": "How do user interviews and feedback loops influence the design of the minimum viable product (MVP)?",
        "answer": "User interviews and feedback loops are crucial for designing an MVP that strikes a balance between showing enough functionality to demonstrate value without being overly complex. By focusing on positive user experiences and feedback from early users, the team can prioritize features that are most appreciated by the user base. In the case discussed, the team identified three positive interactions and focused on creating a simple product that leveraged these insights.",
        "time": "00:35:02"
      },
      {
        "question": "What considerations were made when designing the initial MVP for the financial product?",
        "answer": "When designing the initial MVP, the team focused on simplicity, aiming to incorporate only those features that would create a pure and easy-to-use experience for the user, such as easy access to source documents and data presentation in an excel-like format. The idea was to collect all positive user moments into a simple product, rather than adding complex web UI features that could confuse users.",
        "time": "00:36:40"
      },
      {
        "question": "How did the team know they had a substantial product idea?",
        "answer": "The team knew they had a substantial product idea when they received positive feedback and immediate interest from their network after sharing a simple financial model as part of their MVP. This led to discussions about monetizing the concept and prompted the team to scale up their infrastructure to handle more models. The validation came from the market's reaction and the realization that they had identified a significant problem to solve.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Why is it important to balance automation and human interaction in AI products?",
        "answer": "Balancing automation and human interaction is important because it allows for a scalable solution that benefits from the strengths of both. Automation handles repetitive tasks efficiently, while human interaction can improve and enhance the AI, making it more effective and adaptable. This combination can lead to a competitive advantage and solve problems that pure AI or human solutions might struggle with due to complexity or lack of scalability.",

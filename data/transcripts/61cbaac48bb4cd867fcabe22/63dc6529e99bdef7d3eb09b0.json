You know h of a teams um in high touch enables them to easily essentially abstract the paid engineering work you would have to do to get the data from your data rehouse to um a system of record for function like sales force or next song or marketer or any of these kind of sales and marketing um cloud software companies.

Um sitting on the assets, I think hy touch we feel is, is now kind of the this sort of segment leader and diversity to L. I think the second piece of controversial is whether you even if he was a category that could be a Better scale outcome and and you know of course, like all things, jury is still out. But I think one of the really interesting things and that we've discovered in over last few years, really the team is discovered and unfortunate to learn from them as a result, is that um uh uh you know that that not only would did engineering teams want to leverage this, but that um business teams would want to leverage high touch and that we can cross sell in additional s no code verses not in low code experience to the marketing team, with the sales team, with the finance team and that that pieces of itself actually that could be very valuable and in fact replaces some others.

        "answer": "Kevin started at the startup as a 'do whatever is needed' role and quickly ran marketing campaigns and eventually managed the product.

        "answer": "At BCV, some of Kevin's key investments include HighTouch, a pioneer in the reverse PL category, which allows businesses to easily use their data in various operational functions like sales and marketing. The investment is considered controversial due to questions about whether the category was clear in the market and whether companies would choose to buy such a service instead of building it themselves. However, HighTouch's success and the cross-selling potential to other teams within a business have shown its value. Another investment is Kaniko, which was acquired by a strategic buyer. These investments are significant due to their potential to disrupt traditional business practices and their innovative approach to solving common business challenges.",

        "question": "What factors contributed to the ease of creating a billion-dollar business in the IT sector?",
        "answer": "The ease of creating a billion-dollar business in the IT sector was significantly contributed to by the highly favorable macroeconomic conditions and financial policies, particularly the availability of zero and negative interest rates which promoted speculative behavior and directed capital towards unproductive use cases.",

      },
      {
        "question": "What impact did IT market conditions have on companies' capitalization and growth?",
        "answer": "The IT market conditions made it very easy to raise money, resulting in companies that may not have had product-market fit or a large market opportunity still being showered with capital. This led to rapid expansion and hiring, only to discover later that they did not actually have product-market fit.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Why might the IT sector be considered profitable despite high valuations?",
        "answer": "Despite high valuations, the IT sector might be considered profitable because software companies have very low customer churn rates and the cost to reproduce their products is minimal, which should lead to profitability. The current inflation of valuations is thought to be driven by the abundance of capital in IT, causing a loss of discipline in the market.",

        "question": "In what ways is the macroeconomic environment affecting early-stage IT companies?",
        "answer": "The macroeconomic environment is influencing early-stage IT companies by adjusting their expectations to reflect the reality of the public market.

      },
      {
        "question": "Why does IT growth lag behind market expectations and how can this be addressed?",
        "answer": "IT growth often lags behind market expectations due to a few reasons, such as input costs not adjusting appropriately, which prevents companies from validating their progress with the available funds. Additionally, the supply of dollars exceeds demand, leading to an oversaturation of capital in the market. Addressing this involves adjusting input costs, software prices, and being selective in the types of investments made to ensure alignment with macroeconomic conditions.",

        "answer": "Common misconceptions about product market fit (PMF) include mistaking revenue growth for PMF, as seen in financial services where companies could increase sales without being profitable. Another misconception is the belief that any level of customer acquisition is a sign of PMF, which overlooks the quality and scalability of the customer segment.

In contrast, Magic's automation is business-user driven, human-in-the-loop, and not fully automated, requiring a different product shape and a different way of selling that is browser-based.

        "answer": "Missing out on investments can lead to reflection on the reasons behind the missed opportunity. It is mentioned that it is dangerous to assume a company's success based solely on its ability to raise funds. Instead, long-term success often involves fundamentals like sound financials. The speaker admits to missing a significant investment opportunity in a data infrastructure company, acknowledging a lack of foresight in appreciating the growth of the data function. From these experiences, the importance of having a keen understanding of a company's fundamentals and the potential for growth is emphasized.",

        "answer": "The speaker's confidence in their own judgment has evolved by building their own conviction, moving away from relying on others' opinions. Early investments that required them to lead financings were pivotal in gaining confidence. Over time, they have learned to trust their own judgment and intuitions, particularly in choosing to back emerging talent over following trends.",

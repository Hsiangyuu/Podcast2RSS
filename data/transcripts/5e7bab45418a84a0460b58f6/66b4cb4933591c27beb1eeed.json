        "question": "What is the unusual idea mentioned in relation to the release of the author's new novel?",
        "answer": "The unusual idea mentioned in relation to the release of the author's new novel is that the story picks up with a character 25 years later in her life, rather than continuing directly from where the previous novel ended. This idea came to the author unexpectedly and was not planned as a sequel but developed over time, reflecting on the character's life at a different point.",

        "question": "Why did the author choose to write about a character in 'Brooklyn' in the new novel?",
        "answer": "The author chose to write about a character from 'Brooklyn' in the new novel because he had always been interested in the character and had maintained an emotional connection to her over a long period. He also noted that seeing the character, named Eilish, played by Donald Westlake in the movie adaptation of 'Brooklyn' influenced his writing and the character's development in the new work.",

        "answer": "The new novel by the Irish author explores the theme of identity and belonging by presenting the story of Eilish, who is faced with choices about leaving and returning to America. It examines her identity through the lens of her experiences in various places, including her Irish background and the conflicting feelings of being at home or drifting through different locations. The novel questions the notion of finding a true sense of home and the irony of the term 'home' in different contexts.",

        "answer": "The theme of secrets in the author's works is significant as it revolves around the characters' reluctance to reveal truths for valid reasons, such as not wanting to be a subject of constant conversation or avoid disrupting a special occasion. Secrets are portrayed as having the power to be corrosive or damaging, yet not all secrets are harmful.

This approach allows the reader to experience the full impact of an event within the context of the story, creating a heightened sense of tension and realism.",

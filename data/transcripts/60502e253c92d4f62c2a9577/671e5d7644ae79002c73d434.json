One is more on the news gathering sight and um so redis had a product I think in twenty seven or twenty eighteen, which is called news tracer and it's basically doing something that a Normal human being, a reporter will not be able to do basic scrapes, seven hundred million daily trees from backend as twitter and basically it's identifying what are the breaking news.

So gives to us for an agency that win um the competition by time, like something around five minutes to twenty minutes lead time um comp competitors.

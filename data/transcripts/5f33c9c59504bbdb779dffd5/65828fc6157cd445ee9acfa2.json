So penal v two is designed to cater to that. So at the contract layer, permissionless asset listing is already possible. What we're missing at this point is to have an interface that allows users to very simply indicate the access that they want to depot and the parameters that they want to set for the pool.

And in twenty twenty one and a good part of twenty twenty two, IT was just pull market and yields were like users wouldn't think too highly of uh, fixed income products because in a bull market yeah just speculating on you and and optimizing for gains made a lot of sense that for for most assets at this.

But I think there because in a in a bull market, though, there were so many different opportunities. I think investors, I had to consider the opportunity cost of investing in the product that might take maybe three, four years to mature and versus investing in a product that already has a product market fit. And uh, that could that could be liquid in six months to a year and then allow them to have a pretty quick exit that can and with the proceeds to be ruled into a different, different product category. Um so I think that was something that we had to we had to go through um but fortunately for us, we were able to aggregate sufficient interest from a group of very reliable builders um and I remember loy天天um so of this this this were some of the earlier livers in in our vision and because of their involvement，we were able to on board a few other investors, for example, eclipsed c capital um and that mechanism Sparked a lion style as well.",

They hold sudden size of equities or more importantly, tokens of a lot of uh some of the projects. And if they are token holders and if the tokens liquid IT is also a possibility that some investors might not want to honor the vesting schedule or the holding period and then they would just sell IT um to the market and exit cleanly, which would increase and doing so would increase the selling pressure for the token um and generally when that happens, the community would lose faith in the project because the Price no longer alliance with um what the user is anticipating and IT makes a very difficult case for the for the project order taken to bounce back.",

So as an example, right, I think in the case of trade fy, when you are a list company, typically you have already generated pretty healthy, careful, doesn't matter whether is positive or not, and you already have some resources to hire the professionals to help manage a plate, public reports and and road shows. But in the case of critter, because things are so public and so fast moving, when you have a lot of these community token holders, they can they can uh of course, make suggestions and sometimes they can be quite host yle if if the protocol Operator does things that that that do not really um aligned with what the community thinks. And with that, I think sometimes in the absence of resources, IT can be quite difficult to manage the expectations of the community. So um yeah that this is not a common, but I think typically um with with community, uh III don't see sorry even though this is not in common, um I think most um protocols uh sorry, communities are are reasonably a quite reasonable um and they they they wouldn't make a fast out of uh a protocol unless there's something to to complain about.",

The expectation for vesting schedule in a bull market, especially in 2021, was not for it to be too long, and there was no need to go above and beyond to be too differentiated on that front.

        "question": "What is the strategy for tuning incentive levels to control costs while maintaining a steady rate of TVL growth?",
        "answer": "Initially, incentives may need to be more aggressive to attract liquidity. However, as the protocol stabilizes and liquidity growth becomes more stable, it is sensible for the protocol to consider reducing incentives to improve efficiency. The adjustment of incentives should be based on the protocol's marketing plans and the state of the protocol, with a focus on making appropriate changes to achieve balance.",

        "question": "What factors influence the focus on trading volume versus TVL in a protocol's lifecycle?",
        "answer": "Both trading volume and TVL are important but serve different purposes. Initially, focus is on increasing TVL to attract liquidity and provide a good trading experience. As TVL grows, the focus shifts towards trading strategies. The exact time to prioritize one over the other depends on the needs, market situations, and the development stage of the protocol.",
